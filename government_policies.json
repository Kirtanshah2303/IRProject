    "Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana":"Financial inclusion is broadly defined as the process of ensuring easy and reliable\r\n access to the financial services and flow of timely and adequate credit for vulnerable\r\n groups such as weaker sections and low income groups at an affordable cost.\r\n  Financial inclusion acts from the supply side by providing and expanding financial\r\n market and services that people demand from time to time under the changed\r\n circumstances, whereas\r\n  Financial literacy creates/stimulates the demand side by making people aware of that\r\n they can get what they need/demand.\r\n  Financial inclusion is important for India, because it can accelerate socio-economic\r\n growth rate, bring down poverty and income inequality and add value to country’s\r\n sustainable and inclusive growth1\r\n .\r\n  According to Census 2011, only 14.48 crore households (58.70 per cent) of 24.67\r\n crore in the country had access to banking services.PARDHANMANTRI JAN DHAN YOJANA\r\n  With a view to increasing banking penetration and promoting financial inclusion a\r\n National Mission on Financial Inclusion named as Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana\r\n (PMJDY) was formally launched on 28th August, 2014 at national level by the\r\n Prime Minister. PMJDY is aimed at covering all households with at least one bank\r\n account per household across the country.OBJECTIVES OF PMJDY\r\n  Universal access to banking facilities for all households across the country\r\n through a bank branch or a fixed point Business Correspondent (BC) within a\r\n reasonable distance.\r\n  To cover all households with atleast one Basic Bank Account with RuPay Debit\r\n card having inbuilt accident insurance cover of Rs.1 lakh.\r\n  An overdraft facility upto Rs.5000/- after satisfactory operation in the account for\r\n 6 months.\r\n  A Life Cover of Rs.30,000/- to those beneficiaries who open their accounts for\r\n the first time from 15.08.2014 to 31.01.2015.\r\n  Financial literacy programme which aims to take financial literacy upto village\r\n level.\r\n  The Mission also envisages expansion of Direct Benefit Transfer under various\r\n Government Schemes through bank accounts of the beneficiaries.\r\n  Providing micro–insurance to the people.\r\n  Unorganised sector Pension schemes through the Business Correspondents2\r\n .\r\n  Comprehensive financial inclusion of the excluded section is proposed to be\r\n achieved by 14 August 2018.\r\n  Banks have engaged Business Correspondents Agents (BCAs)/Bank Mitras who go\r\n to such areas where opening of a Bank branch/ATM is not viable. These\r\n BCAs/Bank Mitras represent the concerned banks and other banking services3\r\n .ACHIEVEMENTS UNDER PMJDY AS ON 29.6.2016\r\n  22.29 crore accounts have been opened under PMJDY out of which 13.69 crore\r\n accounts are in rural areas and 8.60 crore in urban areas.\r\n  Deposits of Rs. 39251.57 crores has been mobilized.\r\n  18.22 crore RuPay Debit cards have been issued under PMJDY.\r\n  Aadhaar seeding has been done in 10.59 crore PMJDY accounts.\r\n  Zero balance accounts has been reduced to 25.29 per cent4\r\n .\r\n  Routing subsidies and welfare payments through the Jan Dhan scheme has reduced\r\n leakages in subsidy transfer. According to the Economic Survey 2015-16, leakages\r\n in LPG subsidy transfers fell 24 per cent because of the infrastructure created by Jan\r\n Dhan accounts, Aadhaar and mobile networks, (JAM trinity)\r\n 5\r\n .\r\n MAJOR CONCERNS\r\n  Bank account penetration is growing, thanks to Jan Dhan, but in rural areas physical\r\n connectivity to the banking system remains limited, and BCS and mobile money\r\n providers have not yet solved this last mile problem6\r\n .\r\n  Despite Jan Dhan's record breaking feats, basic saving account penetration in most\r\n state is still relatively low which is 46 per cent on average and above 75 per cent in\r\n Madhya Pradesh and Chhatisgarh only7\r\n .\r\n  The speed of linking the accounts with Aadhar number has been very low. Less than\r\n half of the 22.29 crore accounts were seeded with Aadhar as on 29.06.2016.\r\n  Because all accounts are not Aadhar seeded, it is difficult to track if person has\r\n another account or not and that leads to duplication. Progress in reducing dormant account has been slow. As on 29.6.2016, more than 25\r\n per cent of zero balance account meaning the account holders were not using the\r\n bank account.\r\n  Duplicate accounts are also one reason why several accounts are inactive8\r\n .\r\n  Regulations governing the remuneration of BCAs may need to be reviewed to ensure\r\n that commission rates are sufficient to encourage BCAs to remain active\r\n 9\r\n .\r\n  According to a study by MicroSave for the Finance Ministry, insufficient income for\r\n banking correspondents and a deficiency in training, supervision and infrastructure\r\n for these last mile delivery agents have impeded the reach of the Government\r\n flagship scheme10\r\n .\r\n  Accounts opened under the PMJDY could be very vulnerable to fraud practices.\r\n Banks need to clearly guard against misuse of these accounts from money mulling.\r\n  Banks should have robust system to monitor such accounts and the transaction made\r\n therein11\r\n .\r\n CONCLUSION\r\n The significant change under the PMJDY is that the financial inclusion objective\r\n has moved beyond the provision of simple no-frills accounts to meeting overall\r\n financial needs of the poor, linking government benefits, overdraft facility and insurance\r\n and pension to these saving accounts. The massive campaign around PMJDY led to a\r\n surge in awareness, and for the first time in decades, bank officials, who would pursue\r\n people to open accounts to meet their mandated targets, reported being pushed by\r\n customers themselves",
